            so this whole mobile wrapper around the logo is making more sense.  As in it is clickable

            the logo-->

              not have the symbol on my keyboard that goes into the quotation marks..but this is clearly
              all within the logo wrapper and my suspicion ias that this logo wrapper is used elsewhere
              on the which creates the necessity of another anchor with different properties.-->
